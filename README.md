## Project:  Chitech / Esp32 Thing

Chitech is a psychometric IoT device that monitors your dogâ€™s shaking patterns. Chitech is accompanied with the Chitech webapp in which gives you a better insight into the psychology of your pet. 


### Detailed Project Description

Wearable technology in today's consumer market  has expanded to include products tailored to our closest companions, our pets. These devices have given pet owners the ability to closely monitor their furry companions with the hopes of using  the data gathered to improve their pets health and wellness. As a proud owner of a four year old Chihuahua (named Chloe), wearable technology for animals inspired me to construct my own. 

Small dogs, especially Chihuahuas are known to respond to excitement by shaking. From my interest in discovering what excites Chloe the most, my idea for Chitech was born. My product is a non-invasive wearable device tailored for small dogs. This device detects vibrations and transmits that data to the accompanying webapp where pet owners can get a better understanding of their dog's behavioral patterns. 

When the Chitech device detects that the dog is shaking, it transmits that data to the webapp. The webapp then prompts the user to record the nature of the event that triggered the excitable response. Through time, the user is able to analyze the data collected in order to get a deeper understanding of their dog's motivations and preferences. 

There is both a utilitarian and an analytical component to Chitech. My prototype explores how the data collected from our beloved pets is being protected and disseminated by the companies selling these wearable devices. 

### Technical Description

I chose to use the Esp32 thing because it is small enough to comfortably be attached to my five pound dog, Chloe. There was some prepping involved for getting the esp32 thing ready for use. First of all, I decided to solder some headers onto the microcontroller for easy connection. 

I faced two challenges when working on the hardware. First of all, finding a sensor that accurately and consistenly detected vibrations was extremely challenging. At first I attempted to use an uncovered and covered Piezo Element, running multiple trials and comparing the results from each sensor. Despite countless trials, the piezo element continued to give variable and unrealiable vibration readings. 

The Piezo Vibration Sensor proved to the most adequate sensor for Chitech since it accurately detected vibrations when the device was shaken. However the Piezo Vibration Sensor proved to only accurately detect a standard "shake" when it had a weight attached to it. As a solution to this problem, I chose to tape two nails onto the sensor since the nails were compact and heavy enough to product consistent results. I chose to tape the nails instead of gluing them for fear that the latter would potentially ruin the sensor. 

#### Code

< Explain your code.  You might include code snippets, either `inline` or
```c++
//Multiline
bool photon_fun = TRUE;
```
You should link to your full code, either included in the repository (e.g. [my_code.ino](code/my_code.ino)  or to the Shared Revision in your Particle IDE. >
