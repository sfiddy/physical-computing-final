## Project:  Chitech / Esp32 Thing

Chitech is a psychometric IoT device that monitors your dogâ€™s shaking patterns. Chitect is accompanied with the Chitech webapp in which gives you a better insight into the psychology of your pet. 


### Detailed Project Description

Wearable technology in today's consumer market  has expanded to include products tailored to our closest companions, our pets. These devices have given pet owners the ability to closely monitor their furry companions with the hopes of using  the data gathered to improve their pets health and wellness. As a proud owner of a four year old Chihuahua (named Chloe), wearable technology for animals inspired me to construct my own. 

Small dogs, especially Chihuahuas are known to respond to excitement by shaking. From my interest in discovering what excites Chloe the most, my idea for Chitech was born. My product is a non-invasive wearable device tailored for small dogs. This device detects vibrations and transmits that data to the accompanying webapp where pet owners can get a better understanding of their dog's behavioral patterns. 

When the Chitech device detects that the dog is shaking, it transmits that data to the webapp. The webapp then prompts the user to record the nature of the event that triggered the excitable response. Through time, the user is able to analyze the data collected in order to get a deeper understanding of their dog's motivations and preferences. 

There is both a utilitarian and an analytical component to Chitech. My prototype explores how the data collected from our beloved pets is being protected and disseminated by the companies selling these wearable devices. 

### Technical Description

< Explain the "how" of your project.  What are the hardware components?  What are the software components?  How do they interact with each other? >

< You can also explain the development process here >

< Insert Picture and explanation of Your Wiring Diagram here >

#### Code

< Explain your code.  You might include code snippets, either `inline` or
```c++
//Multiline
bool photon_fun = TRUE;
```
You should link to your full code, either included in the repository (e.g. [my_code.ino](code/my_code.ino)  or to the Shared Revision in your Particle IDE. >
